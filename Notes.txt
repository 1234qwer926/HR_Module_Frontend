21 CFR Part 11 Compliance Checklist

1. Validation and System Controls:
   - Validation Documentation: Includes Installation Qualification (IQ), Operational Qualification (OQ), and Performance Qualification (PQ).
   - System Access Control: Implements rate limiting, access controls for individuals, and role-based security to protect endpoints.
   - Data Integrity: The system must have measures in place to ensure that data has not been altered during transmission from a device to the system.

2. Audit Trails:
   - Deletion Policy: Utilizes "soft deletes" (marking records as deleted) instead of "hard deletes" (permanent removal) to preserve record history.
   - Change Logs: Maintains detailed logs of every change in the database, including a unique ID and the type of operation (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

3. Electronic Signatures:
   - 1. Uniqueness and Security:
     - Each employee who interacts with the system is assigned a unique user ID and password, which serves as their electronic signature.
     - Real-World Application: When a manager approves an SOP, they log in with unique credentials. The system ensures this user ID is never reassigned, guaranteeing that every action is tied to a specific individual.

   - 2. Signature Linking:
     - Once a record is signed, the electronic signature is permanently and securely linked to that specific version of the document.
     - Real-World Application: The signature is a cryptographic binding of the signer's identity, the timestamp, and the document's content. Any alteration to the document post-signature would invalidate the signature. It cannot be copied to another document.

   - 3. Signature Components:
     - When a signed record is viewed or printed, the signature must be represented in a clear, human-readable format.
     - Real-World Application: The system displays the signer's printed name ("John Smith"), the date and time ("August 22, 2025, 2:15 PM"), and the meaning of the signature ("Approved"), making the context clear.

   - 4. Identity Verification:
     - The system requires the user to re-authenticate themselves at the moment of signing to confirm their identity.
     - Real-World Application: After clicking "Approve," a dialog box prompts the user to re-enter their password. This two-factor process (login + re-authentication) verifies the signer's identity.

4. Record Management:
   - 1. Record Generation and Copies:
     - The system must be able to generate accurate and complete copies of electronic records in both human-readable (e.g., PDF) and electronic formats for inspection.
     - Real-World Application: A lab technician enters results into a LIMS. For an FDA inspection, the LIMS must produce a complete PDF report (human-readable) and an electronic copy that preserves the original record's content and meaning.

   - 2. Data Export:
     - The system must support exporting records in standard formats to facilitate review, transfer, and long-term archival.
     - Real-World Application: A biotech company needs to submit stability data. The LIMS can export this data as a PDF for easy review or as an XML/CSV file for data analysis and import into other systems. Using checksums can ensure data integrity during export.

5. Documentation and Policies:
   - 1. User and System Documentation:
     - The vendor must provide comprehensive, controlled documentation for system operation, maintenance, and training.
     - Real-World Application: This includes user manuals, admin guides for backups and security, and a formal change control process for the documentation itself, ensuring it always matches the validated system.

   - 2. Written Policies:
     - The organization must establish formal written policies that hold individuals accountable for actions taken under their electronic signatures.
     - Real-World Application: The company creates an "Electronic Records and Signatures Policy" stating that credentials are the legal equivalent of a handwritten signature, passwords must not be shared, and individuals are accountable for all actions under their user ID.

   - 3. Training:
     - All personnel who use, maintain, or develop the system must be adequately trained, and this training must be documented.
     - Real-World Application: A new engineer completes vendor-provided training, internal role-based training, and a review of the company's policies. This training is formally documented in their employee record as proof of qualification.
